👋🏻   I am currently pursuing my studies in Software Engineering at [Daffodil International University](https://daffodilvarsity.edu.bd/). My journey as a software engineering student is defined by my passion for technology, my commitment to learning, and my enthusiasm for solving complex problems. I am excited about the future opportunities that await me and dedicated to making a positive impact through my work in software engineering.

👋🏻   I am the co-founder at [CodeSinners](https://www.codesinners.com) - CodeSinners is a blog site where content is published according to the needs of software engineering students. It's a group of seven aspiring software engineers. Through our blogs, we’re excited to document the software journey, share our insights, and provide valuable content to our fellow learners.

✍️   I am a writer for a popular technology blog site that publishes community troubleshooting, tutorials and technical updates.

🌱   My development skills include SDLC, SRS, C/C++, Java, DSA, OOP, and many more. Now I am developing more skills to give better service to the software world.
