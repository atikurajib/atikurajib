### Atikur Rahman Rajib

🏫   I am pursuing my Software Engineering studies at [Daffodil International University](https://daffodilvarsity.edu.bd/). My journey as a software engineering student is defined by my passion for technology, commitment to learning, and enthusiasm for solving complex problems. I am excited about the future opportunities that await me and dedicated to making a positive impact through my work in software engineering.

💼   I am the co-founder at [CodeSinners](https://www.codesinners.com) - CodeSinners is a blog platform where content is published according to the needs of software engineering students. It's a group of seven aspiring software engineers. We’re excited to document the software journey through our blogs, share our insights, and provide valuable content to our fellow learners.

✍️   I write for a popular technology blog that publishes community troubleshooting, tutorials and technical updates.

🌱   My development skills include Agile, Java, DSA, and many more. Now I am developing more skills to give better service to the software world.
